## For Loop Closure 2

### Instructions

In the previous activity, we reviewed some code that did not behave the way we wanted it to. We wanted code that when executed, printed out the value of `i` at the point in the for loop when the `setTimeout` was created. In this activity, we're going to be writing that code, but with a lot of restrictions in order to get more practice with closure and immediately invoked functions again.

* Each call of `setTimeout` must console log the value of `i` when it is created.

* Do not change any code outside of the designated area, which means you're defining the first argument passed to `setTimeout`.
    * Keep this in mind and remember the tools you used to solve the other activity regarding closure and immediately invoked functions

* If you need more guidance, refer to the `hint.md` file within the hint folder.
