## Change Iteration Count

### Instructions

`changeIterCount` takes in a value in cents and an array of coin values as arguments and returns the number of ways to create that value using the coins given.

* For example, given a value of `4` cents and the coin denominations `[1,2]`, the `changeIterCount` function should return `5` because we also care about the order in which the coins are represented.

    ```javascript
    [1, 1, 1, 1]
    [1, 1, 2]
    [1, 2, 1]
    [2, 1, 1]
    [2, 2]
    ```
