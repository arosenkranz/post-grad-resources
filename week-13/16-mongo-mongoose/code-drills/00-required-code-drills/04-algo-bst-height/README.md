## Binary Search Height

### Instructions

Consider the the following diagram of a Binary Search Tree(preview this file or open it elsewhere if you are reading this from a text editor):

</p>

`Your job is to find the height of a given binary search tree.`

The height of a binary search tree is simply the number of rows that trees contains. 

So if we look at the diagram above, the height of that tree is 5.... There are five rows

To solve this problem, it is very important to consider the structure and rules of a binary search tree.

In prompt, you are given some pre-built constructors with an empty lca function. You are also given some tests.

In hint, you are given all the above as well as some pseudocode.

`Look for "YOUR WORK HERE" to find where your code should be written.`
