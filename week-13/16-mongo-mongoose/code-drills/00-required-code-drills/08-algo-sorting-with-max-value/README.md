## Sorting Scores

### Instructions 

So far, you've dealt with sorting algorithms where the fastest it could sort an array was in O(n*log(n)) time. However, by restraining the range of the values within the array, we move from a O(n*log(n)) time complexity to O(n).

* Given an array of values where each value is between 0 and 99, write a function that will sort that array in ascending order.

* You should be able to complete this in O(n) time complexity because you know the range of values for the numbers.
