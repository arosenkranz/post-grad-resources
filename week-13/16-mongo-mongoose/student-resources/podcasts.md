[The Meaning Of Work](https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/443411154/the-meaning-of-work)
>Love it or hate it, most of us have to work for a living. So, how can we make work more meaningful? This hour, TED speakers explore our values and motivations when it comes to the workplace.

[Driverless Dilemma](http://www.radiolab.org/story/driverless-dilemma/)
>Most of us would sacrifice one person to save five. It’s a pretty straightforward bit of moral math. But if we have to actually kill that person ourselves, the math gets fuzzy.

>That’s the lesson of the classic Trolley Problem, a moral puzzle that fried our brains in an episode we did about 11 years ago. Luckily, the Trolley Problem has always been little more than a thought experiment, mostly confined to conversations at a certain kind of cocktail party. That is until now. New technologies are forcing that moral quandry out of our philosophy departments and onto our streets. So today we revisit the Trolley Problem and wonder how a two-ton hunk of speeding metal will make moral calculations about life and death that we can’t even figure out ourselves.

[Talking to Machines](http://www.radiolab.org/story/137407-talking-to-machines/)
>We begin with a love story--from a man who unwittingly fell in love with a chatbot on an online dating site. Then, we encounter a robot therapist whose inventor became so unnerved by its success that he pulled the plug. And we talk to the man who coded Cleverbot, a software program that learns from every new line of conversation it receives...and that's chatting with more than 3 million humans each month. Then, five intrepid kids help us test a hypothesis about a toy designed to push our buttons, and play on our human empathy. And we meet a robot built to be so sentient that its creators hope it will one day have a consciousness, and a life, all its own.

[The End Of Privacy](https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/265352348/the-end-of-privacy?showDate=2014-01-31)
>January 31, 2014 • In this hour, TED speakers explore our changing notions of privacy, the consequences, and whether privacy will soon be a relic of the past.

[Why is my website slow?](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/why-is-my-website-slow)
>You've got an amazing website. It's beautiful, functional, but it takes forever to load. What do you do? Where do you even begin to debug that? Lara Hogan, VP of Engineering at Kickstarter and author of the book, Designing for Performance, breaks down common web performance issues, tools you can use to diagnose the problem, and how to use AB testing to measure your results. We also have another episode of the Coding Corner, where we unpack three common mistakes newbies make when trying to speed things up!

[Is The Website Down?](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/is-the-website-down)
>When one man decided to crowdfund a bailout for Greece on Indiegogo (a feat that required over a billion dollars), Stella Cotton and her team found themselves in trouble. The site went down, and they had to figure out what to do. Stella takes us through the journey of getting the Indiegogo site back up, shares what she’s learned about site availability and what CodeNewbies can do to be ready for their own heavy traffic.


[What We Fear](https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/312542881/what-we-fear?showDate=2014-05-23)
>May 23, 2014 • In this hour, TED speakers explore what it means to be afraid, and how we calm ourselves down — or don't — when we're terrified.


[Darkode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/darkode/)
>It would seem that hackers today can do just about anything they want - from turning on the cellphone in your pocket to holding your life's work hostage. Cyber criminals today have more sophisticated tools, have learned to work collaboratively around the world and have found innovative ways to remain deep undercover in the internet's shadows. This episode, we shine a light into those shadows to see the world from the perspectives of both cybercrime victims and perpetrators.

>First we meet mother-daughter duo Alina and Inna Simone, who tell us about being held hostage by criminals who have burrowed into their lives from half a world away. Along the way we learn about the legally sticky spot that unwitting accomplices like Will Wheeler find themselves in.

>Then reporter and author Joseph Menn tells us about the surprisingly lucrative professional hacker structure in places throughout the former Soviet Union. Finally, the co-creator of one of the most notorious online marketplaces to ever exist speaks to us and NPR cyber-crime expert Dina Temple-Raston about how a young suburban Boy Scout can turn into a world renowned black hat hacker.



[Ep. 164 - What's a container?](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast)
>If you've heard of containers and this thing called Kubernetes, but you're not sure exactly how they work and what they are, this episode is for you. Kelsey Hightower of Google gives us a newbie friendly tour of the world of containers. We talk about what problems they solve, and what new developers should know about them.

[Predicting The Future](https://www.npr.org/2013/08/26/215826949/predicting-the-future?showDate=2014-10-10)
>October 10, 2014 • In this hour, TED speakers make bold predictions about our future and what our future lives might look like.

[The Power Of Crowds](https://www.npr.org/2012/05/16/152866680/the-power-of-crowds?showDate=2012-05-18)
>May 18, 2012 • Technology-enabled collaboration draws us closer, makes us smarter and allows us to innovate using the wisdom of a crowd. A new wave of collaborative consumption is transforming consumerism and the rules of engagement. What's the true potential of crowdsourcing?


[Ep. 86 - Intro to Databases](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/intro-to-databases)
>Mark Nadal was a front end developer looking for a better database. So he built his own. He walks us through the different types of databases, the limitations you might run into as you use them, and why he decided to build his own graph database.

[Limits of Science](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91712-limits-of-science/)
>Dr. Steve Strogatz wonders if we've reached the limits of human scientific understanding, and should soon turn the reins of research over to robots. Cold, calculating robots. Then, Dr. Hod Lipson and Michael Schmidt walk us through the workings of a revolutionary computer program that they developed--a program that can deduce mathematical relationships in nature, through simple observation. The catch? As Dr. Gurol Suel explains, the program gives answers to complex biological questions that we humans have yet to ask, or even to understand.


[This Is How Much the Internet Knows About You](http://www.wnyc.org/story/crystal-knows-email/)

[Intro to Data Science](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/intro-to-data-science)
>If you've heard of open data, big data, and data science and never quite knew what it was all about, this episode is for you. Briana helps us explore the different steps it takes to answer a complex data question with code, giving us a tour of the data science world along the way. We talk about the importance and difficulty of cleaning data, the role of ethics in data collection and analysis, and how a codenewbie can dig into this fascinating topic.

[Press Play](https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/390249044?showDate=2015-03-27)
>March 27, 2015 • In this episode, TED speakers describe how all forms of amusement — from tossing a ball to video games — can make us smarter, saner and more collaborative. (Original broadcast date: March 27, 2015)


[The Ethics of Coding](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/the-ethics-of-coding)
>Bill Sourour was twenty-one when he was asked to build a website for a pharmaceutical company. It was a quiz that asked users to select symptoms so that it could recommend a drug as a possible solution. But for almost every option the user selected, the quiz would recommend the same drug. It didn’t feel right, but when Bill later heard that a side effect of the drug was depression and a young woman who had taken that drug had committed suicide, it felt very, very wrong. Bill tells us the story of his first code-related ethical conflict, his thoughts on the role of ethics in coding, and how the incident affects how he approaches code today.
