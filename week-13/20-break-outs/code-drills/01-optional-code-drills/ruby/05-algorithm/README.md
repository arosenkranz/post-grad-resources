Given 3, you should print:
```
"  #  "
" ### "
"#####"
```
Given 4, you should print:
```
"   #   "
"  ###  "
" ##### "
"#######"
```
Given 8, you should print:
```
"         #         "
"        ###        "
"       #####       "
"      #######      "
"     #########     "
"    ###########    "
"   #############   "
"  ###############  "
