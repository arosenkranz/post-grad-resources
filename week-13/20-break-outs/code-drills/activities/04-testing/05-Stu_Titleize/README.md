# Titleize

In this activity we will write a function that should title-case a given string and write a test for it.

## Instructions

* Your task is to write tests for a function that title-cases incoming names. For example: `titleize('mr jones')` returns 'Mr Jones'. "joe shmoe" returns "Joe Shmoe"

We will be writing tests one-by-one. Within each sequential folder, you will find a README. Follow the instructions therein, then wait for the instructor before moving to the next folder. 

### Bonus

* Create an array of titles, such as Dr; Mr; Ms; etc. If the string begins with such a title, capitalize it, and append a period.
