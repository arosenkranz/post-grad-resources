# Disemvowel
(15 mins)
In this activity we will write tests for a function designed to remove all vowels from a given string.

## Instructions

* Familiarize yourself with the Mocha and Chai documentation. Choose to read either the should, expect, or assert guide, and refer to it throughout the exercise.

* Consider a function, called `disemvowel`, which accepts a string and returns a version of the string without vowels.

* Your task is to use Chai to write a test suite for `disemvowel`. The catch is that you don't get an implementation yet. First,

  * With your partner, determine what a "representative example" of an input to `disemvowel` might be.

  * What do we expect to receive? What should the function return of this input?

  * What different formats can this sort of input take?

  * What _don't_ we expect? What should happen in this case? _Hint_: Just come up with something reasonable. We're not going to make you guess how we handled errors, so you don't have to write a test for this.

* When you think you're done, explain to your partner why the test you've written totally describes `disemvowel`. Be prepared to explain your test suite to the class.
