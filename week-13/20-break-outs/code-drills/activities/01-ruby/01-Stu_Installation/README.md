# Ruby 

## Introduction & Installation

### Introduction

Per Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, Ruby was built to feel "natural". It is designed to be an intuitive language. 

Ruby has been used to build several prevalent web applications, including:
 - Airbnb
 - Github
 - Dribbble
 - Goodreads
 - Kickstarter
 - Bleacher Report
 - Funny or Die

Ruby is an object-oriented programming language. You can use it as an alternative to Node. In other words, _you can only use Ruby on the backend_.

### Instructions

#### Mac users

Ruby should already be installed on your device. Run `ruby -v` from the command line. If it display a version to you (instead of saying something like: command "ruby" not found), you're all set.
