# Import the hash for your own store from the previous exercise. 

# 1. Loop through the items in your store, and print each item on a separate line.
# ============ YOUR WORK HERE ============



# ============ END WORK AREA ============


# 2. Convert each item in your items array into a hash. Each hash should have a key of name, which points to the item originally in that spot in the array. They should also have a key of id, which points to a unique id. You should already have the tools to accomplish this, but there is pseudocode for you in prompt.rb too. Print out your inventory
# ============ YOUR WORK HERE ============

# Create a copy of the array in your store hash

#  Set your inventory to an empty array

#  Set up a counter that starts at 0. 

# Create a while loop that can account that stops when your counter's value is the same as the amount of items in your inventory. (HINT: Ruby has a .length method too).

#  For each item in your inventory, create a hash with two keys:
# name: set to the item in your inventory.
# id: a unique value for each item (HINT: you've already created an incrementing variable)
#  Don't forget to create a mechanism that will eventually get us out of the while loop
# Print out your inventory

# ============ END WORK AREA ============


# 3. Dynamically create an array of every other item from your inventory (So if my inventory was [1,2,3,4,5,6], I would create [2,4,6]).

# 4. Remove all the items in the array you created in the last exercise from your inventory.
# ============ YOUR WORK HERE ============



# ============ END WORK AREA ============


# 5. For each item, add a key of price and set it to `2.50`.
