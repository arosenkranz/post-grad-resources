# Ruby

## Basic Syntax

## Instructions
In this exercise, we'll be setting up a shop using ruby!

To run a file in ruby, simply enter `ruby` (just as you would `node`) and then the file name in the command line.

To complete this exercise, you'll need to learn some ruby syntax. Open up `examples.rb` to examine some code. Everything you need to complete this exercise will be found in that file.

In `prompt.rb`: 

1. Create your store's profile using a hash. You must include at least 4 different keys, and one of those keys must point to an array of items your store sells. The keys can include things like number of store locations, headquarters, profits, etc...

2. Print out a short bio about your store using some of the keys in the hash you just created.

3. Print all the items your store sells using your hash.

4. Add 5 new items to your "warehouse" (array) and print out your updated stores.

5. Remove three items from your "warehouse" (array) and print out your updated stores.
