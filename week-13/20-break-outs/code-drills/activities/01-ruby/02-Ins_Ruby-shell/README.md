## Ruby Shell

### Instructions

1. In node, we can open enter shell commands by running `node` from the command line. In ruby, we run `irb` from the command line

2. Run `puts "Hello World"` from the ruby shell. You should see:
```ruby
Hello World
=> nil
```
Per Ruby's own website: "But then what’s the => nil bit? That’s the result of the expression. puts always returns nil, which is Ruby’s absolutely-positively-nothing value."

3. Next, run some mathematic operations from the ruby shell. Add, subtract, multiply numbers. Try and play around with different commands to see what you can do.

4. To back out of the ruby process type `quit`, then hit enter.
