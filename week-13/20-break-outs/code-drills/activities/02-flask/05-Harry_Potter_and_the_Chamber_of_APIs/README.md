# Harry Potter and the Chamber of APIs

You've managed to access the Chamber of APIs! In this exercise you will be using `Flask` to create API routes that returns data from the Harry Potter API. Each route will use the request library to make a GET request to the Harry Potter API servers and in turn return JSON content when your routes are hit.

The first route and its request parameters have been given to you! Use this as a base to concoct your next spells.

The frontend and html templates have also been conjoured for you so your task is to merely make the magic happen.

## Instructions

* You will be conjuring 2 variable API routes that will make requests to the Harry Potter API.
    * One that is able to take the name of a given house and returns all students in that house
    * A second that takes a name of specific student and returns all information on that student

* Run your server and interact with it to verify that you've used the right spells


## Hintsx

* There are limitations to what you can conjure based on the API service you are using. In this **case** case-sensitivity is of the upmost importance when hitting your routes. You can either account for this within your code, or simple acknowledge it when you search for students.
