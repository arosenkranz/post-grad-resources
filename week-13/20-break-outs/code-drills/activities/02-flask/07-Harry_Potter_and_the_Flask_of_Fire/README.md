# Harry Potter and the Flask of Fire

It is time! For the TriCoder Challege! DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE FLASK OF FIRE?? In this exercise you will be using `Flask` with MongoDB. When your app is intialized, a function will run that makes a request to the Harry Potter API and stores the returned data into a mongo database.

Your challege should look pretty similar by now. You will need to make routes that connect to your mongo database. The links within the frontend currently do not possess the magical capabilities to render a route!

## Instructions

* You will be conjuring 3 variable API routes that will make queries to your database based on the variable path
    * One that is able to take the name of a given house and returns all students in that house
    * A second that takes a name of specific student and returns all information on that student
    * and finally a path that queries the database for 4 specific individuals, and renders a html template with their information

* Run your server and interact with it to verify that you've used the right spells
