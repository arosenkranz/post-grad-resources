## toLowerCase

### Instructions

_In this activity, we're going to writing the toLowerCase method from scratch. The `toLowerCase` function should take in a string and return a new string with all the characters converted to lower case._ 

* If the character is not a letter, leave it alone.

* Do not use the toLowerCase method to complete this activity.

```javascript
toLowerCase("CaMeLcAsE lIkE iT's ThE yEaR 2000");
// Should return
"camelcase like it's the year 2000"
```
