# Developer Tools

## "Hacking" a website

### Instructions

Go to https://www.tailorbrands.com/. Go ahead and make a logo (it's pretty fun). At the final page, you'll be prompted to sign up... don't. 

Instead, using dev tools, see if you can navigate the page by deleting the elements that are blocking you from doing so. 

Next, scroll through and pick your favorite logo. Once you click on it, you may need to use your dev magic again. You won't be able to simply copy the image address like you can with other images. Instead, see if you can find a way to get the image src using dev tools.
