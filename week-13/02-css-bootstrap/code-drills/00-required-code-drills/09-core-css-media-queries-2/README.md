# Responsive Design

## Media Queries pt.2

### Instructions

In this exercise, you're given two divs, each with its own class (`box-red` and `box-blue`). 

Your job is to make `box-red` move down from the top, and `box-blue` move up from the bottom. 

Neither div will have anystyling by default. Their styling will only appear in media queries. This means that at any screen size larger than 1300px wide, you shouldn't be able to see the boxes. 

Your first media query will be at 1300px max-width. This one is already given to you. Your job is to make each box move 10px in 50px increments. 

For example, if box-red is 0px from the top on max-width 1300px, it should be 10px from the top at max-width 1250px, 20px from the top at max-width 1200px etc... The same is true for box-blue, but from the bottom.

You should have break points every 50px from 1300px down to 550px. 

Your final product should look like this:
