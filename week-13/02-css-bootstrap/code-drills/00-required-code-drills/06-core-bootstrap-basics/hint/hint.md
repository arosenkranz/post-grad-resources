* Refer to the [Starter Template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template).

* To center elements within a wrapping element, give it the classes `d-flex justify-content-center`.

* Refer to the [Bootstrap spacing documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/spacing/)

* Using the `mx-auto` class changes the dimensions of elements you did not specifically define a width to.

* Remember that the jumbotron fluid footer that we're making needs to be outside the container much like the navbar.
