[How to teach yourself computer science](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/how-to-teach-yourself-computer-science)

>Vaidehi decided to take on a year-long challenge. She'd pick a computer science topic every week, do tons of research and write a technical blog post explaining it in simple terms and beautiful illustrations. And then she actually did it. She tells us about her project, basecs, how it's changed her as a developer, and how she handles the trolls and negativity from people who don't appreciate her work.

[S1:E1 "Bits, Binary, and Bytes"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>Binary is the foundation of computer science. We give you a beginner-friendly breakdown of how to count in binary (with some fun counting challenges you can join in on!), how it relates to bits and bytes, and why it's important for us to know as developers. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's first blog post, ["Bits, Bytes, Building with Binary."]((https://medium.com/basecs/bits-bytes-building-with-binary-13cb4289aafa))


[S1:E2 "What is encoding?"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)

>Binary is great for computers, but really tough for humans to work with. We need something that's a bit easier for us. That's where encoding comes in. Vaidehi and Saron explore how encoding works and talk through some popular encoding schemes like ASCII, unicode, and base64. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's second blog post, ["Hexes and Other Magical Numbers"]((https://medium.com/basecs/hexs-and-other-magical-numbers-9785bc26b7ee)). Check out the [ASCII table  here](http://www.infocellar.com/binary/ascii-ebcdic.htm).

[S1:E3 "Hex Queen"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>Let's explore a very special number together: 16. It's the core of the hexadecimal system, and, in this episode, we'll learn how to count in hexes, discuss where we might see the hexadecimal system in real life, and breakdown the math that makes number 16 so special. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's second blog post, ["Hexes and Other Magical Numbers"](https://medium.com/basecs/hexs-and-other-magical-numbers-9785bc26b7ee). 

[S1:E4 "Hexes and Colors"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>If you've worked with CSS, you've probably seen colors represented as hex values. But how on earth does #EC152E give us the color red? With a little help of math, we show you how to represent millions of colors in hex values and how those correlate to RGB values. We also dig into the color theory behind those values. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's second blog post, ["Hexes and Other Magical Numbers"](https://medium.com/basecs/hexs-and-other-magical-numbers-9785bc26b7ee). 

[S1:E5 "Linked Lists in Your Apartment"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>You may be familiar with arrays and hashes and variables, but how much do you know about linked lists? We dig into what they are, how they work, and the pros and cons of using this popular data structure. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's blog post, ["What's a Linked List, Anyway? Part 1"](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-1-d8b7e6508b9d). A huge thank you to Twilio for sponsoring this season of the show!

[S1:E6 "A friendly intro to Big O Notation"](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>Big O Notation can be scary. But it doesn't have to be! We unpack this popular cs topic and show you how we can use it to evaluate different data structures (like linked lists!) and make better programming decisions. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's blog post, ["What's a Linked List, Anyway? Part 2"](https://medium.com/basecs/whats-a-linked-list-anyway-part-2-131d96f71996).

[S2:E2 "Queues IRL"  ](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>Where do we see queues in real life? We explore how queues are used in different parts of the tech stack, and help us do awesome things like send email, create animations, and manage requests. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's blog post, ["To Queue or Not to Queue"](https://medium.com/basecs/to-queue-or-not-to-queue-2653bcde5b04).

[S2:E3 "Don't be stumped ... by trees"  ](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)
>What's in a tree? And why do they always seem to pop up in computer science? We dig into the different parts of a tree, and how certain "tree truths" make them so special. Based on Vaidehi Joshi's blog post, ["How To Not Be Stumped By Trees"](https://medium.com/basecs/how-to-not-be-stumped-by-trees-5f36208f68a7).

[S2:E4 "Trees IRL"  ](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs)

>We kick off season 3 with time travel! We go all the way back to 1735 to a lovely place called Königsberg. It had seven bridges and a tricky math problem that led to the creation of graph theory. Can you solve the problem? Based on Vaidehi Joshi's blog post, ["Königsberg: Seven Small Bridges, One Giant Graph Problem"](https://medium.com/basecs/k%C3%B6nigsberg-seven-small-bridges-one-giant-graph-problem-2275d1670a12).
