# Big O Analysis

Express the running times of the following algorithms in Big O notation. Justify your responses.

Some of these are just review. A few apply Big O to algorithms we saw before.

Assume the _worst case_ running timeâ€”i.e., consider only the _maximum_ number of instructions the algorithm could take.

What is the running time of...

* Selection sort? 

* Insertion sort?

* Linear search?

* Binary search?

* Finding duplicates in an array?
