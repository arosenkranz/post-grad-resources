## Make a stack!

### Instructions

Make a stack!

A stack is a data strucutre that can be described by the term LIFO (Last In First Out). The last element added to the array is the first one you can retrieve from it.

A stack acts a lot like an array, but with a more focused scope.

However, some algorithms are best solved only with the methods available to a stack. 

In this exercise, we will make a stack from scratch. Your stack should fall under the following parameters:

- Your stack should be a constructor. 

- Initialize your stack with a data argument. Set its default to an empty arrayÂ (You can do this directly as an argument... for example: function(data = []). If the function is passed an argument, it will take the argument's form otherwise, it will be set to what you defaulted it as in the argument)

- Your stack should have a data property which points to the argument passed to the stack.

- It should have an add method that adds an element to the top of the stack

- It should have a remove method that removes and returns the last element in the stack

- It should have a peek method that shows the last element in the stack
