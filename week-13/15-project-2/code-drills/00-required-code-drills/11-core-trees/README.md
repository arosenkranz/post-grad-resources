# Search Trees

## Building a Tree, Pt.1

### Instructions

By the end of this 3-part exercise, we'll build a tree capable of breadth-first and depth-first searches.

In part one, we'll be building add and remove functions for our tree constructor. 

- add: a function which takes arguments of node, and data and adds a new node with the data handed down from the argument to the children array of the given node.
- remove: a function which takes arguments of node, and data and returns the children arrayof the given node, but without the nodes specified in "data".

In prompt.js, you are given a node constructor. In hint.js, you are given the skeleton of the constructor, as well as some hints.
