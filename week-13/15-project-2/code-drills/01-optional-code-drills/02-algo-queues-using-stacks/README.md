## Makin' Queues out of Stacks ðŸ¤¯

### Instructions
Make a queue out of two stacks. In prompt.js, you are given a constructor that mimicks the behavior of a stack and nothing else. In hint/hint.js, you are given the aforementioned constructor in additon to the skeleton of the queue, as well as some hints.

Create a new queue constructor with the same three methods as the one we made in 02:

- add
- remove
- peek

You can only use the methods of the stack constructor to manipulate your data. Do not use any other data structures for this activity.
