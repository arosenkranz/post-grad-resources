## Fibonacci... Recursively...Recursively...Recursively...Recursively...Recursively...Recursively...Recursively...Recursively...

### Fibonacci Reminder
The Fibonacci sequence is one in which each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. It looks like this:

[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34] etc...

Notice that 0 and the first 1 are taken for granted.

### Instructions
You have likely already solved the fibonacci sequence before... but have you done it recursively?

Given a number, your fibonnaci should return the fibonacci number at that index. So if the function is passed 7, your function should return 13, the 7th number in the fibonacci sequence. 

In this exercise, you'll be asked to solve fibonacci in two different ways: 
- How you normally would
- Recursively

Note: Solving this problem recursively may prove to be quite a challenge. If you struggle a lot, google recursion to get a better idea of how this might work
