## Updated Portfolio Page

### Overview

Project 2 is over! It's time to update your portfolio with what you've accomplished since Project 1.

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but is still *critical* on your journey as a developer.

### Before you Begin

* Revisit your portfolio page

  * Think about what you've accomplished since the last time you updated this

  * Decide which new skills you're hoping to highlight

* Pin some additional repos that you want to share (ideally, make sure at least one of these projects includes back end code)

  * Navigate to your [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/USERNAME?tab=repositories)

  * Click "Customize your pinned repositories"

  * Click the "Repositories you contribute to" checkbox (this will allow you to "pin" Project 1 even if you aren't the "owner")

  * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

  * Make sure each of these projects is deployed and add a link to the deployed project in their README files

### Required: Update your Portfolio Site -- Employer Ready

To receive a passing grade on this assignment, you should meet the following content and design requirements. These are aligned with what you will need to be
[employer ready](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhzeIUMYf1nV2JQcGdkU3ktcnFBLUZ4X09VSXliTUtJZWsw/view).

#### Content

Your updated site should have the following content:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address

* List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the code on GitHub

* At least one project should include back end code

* For each of your projects, copy the repos to your own GitHub profile if you were not the owner of the repo

  * Create your own repo and DO NOT INITIALIZE WITH A GITIGNORE OR A README

  * Pull the latest version of the project from GitHub

  * [Change the `origin` URL to your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/)

  * `git push origin master`

#### Design

The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:

* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes

* Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

### Suggested: Update Portfolio -- Employer Competitive

To receive an "A" on this assignment, you should also meet the following requirements
to ensure your portfolio site will help you be [employer competitive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhzeIUMYf1nV2JQcGdkU3ktcnFBLUZ4X09VSXliTUtJZWsw/view).

#### Competitive Content

* At least 5 deployed projects (both of your projects and three homework assignments)

* External content:

  * Update your LinkedIn with the projects you've worked on so far

  * Update the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem,
  how you solved it, and some information about your technical approach

  * Suggested: refactor some of your code from earlier assignments to make them more readable

* If you used cors-anywhere in Project 1, update it to make sure your API calls will work consistently

  * Use the instructions in [update-cors-anywhere/README.md](./update-cors-anywhere/README.md)

  * Test to make sure your deployed site works

#### Competitive Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a couple guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design: you should be proud to pull out your phone and share
your portfolio site with a friend, family member, or someone at a meetup.

* Polish: choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Images: add a meaningful screenshot for each of your projects
