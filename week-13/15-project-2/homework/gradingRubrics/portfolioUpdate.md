## Updated Portfolio Page

### Overview

This assignment asked students to update their portfolio page now that they've completed project 1.

A passing grade should mostly fit the definition of "Employer Ready" as specified in ["Employer Ready vs. Employer Competitive"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhzeIUMYf1nV2JQcGdkU3ktcnFBLUZ4X09VSXliTUtJZWsw/view).

An "A" should ONLY be given to portfolios that fit the definition of "Employer Competitive."

**What does an A look like?**

* The student has met all of the requirements under "Employer Competitive." This means not only do they have a polished portfolio page linking to at least 5 projects, but they have also updated their GitHub repos with detailed READMEs and their LinkedIn. Only award an A+ if they've also refactored code from an earlier assignment. You should ask them if they're comfortable letting you share their portfolio with the rest of the class, *especially* if they aren't among your most technically strong students to encourage other students who may be struggling with impostor syndrome.

**What does a B look like?**

* The student has met all or nearly all of the requirements under "Employer Ready," they should receive a B. Emphasize that this is the *bare minimum* they should do for a job search and encourage them to make further updates.

**What does a C look like?**

* If a student made a solid attempt and met most of the requirements for being "Employer Ready" but not all of them, they should receive a C. You should make a few notes about what's missing and emphasize the importance of an up-to-date portfolio page in a job search.

**What does a D or F look like?**

* If a student simply resubmitted the same portfolio from earlier in the course without any changes but it still functions, they should receive a D. If a student submitted something but nothing functions, they should receive an F. In either case, you should follow up with the student about meeting in office hours to get it working as it is *critical* that they get a portfolio page deployed. If they don't feel like they have enough to put on a portfolio page, they may need a remediation plan to catch up.

**What does an I look like?**

* A student should receive this grade **only** if they submit an empty repository. If the student attempted the homework assignment and was simply unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a normal letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.
