## Mega-Modular FizzBuzz

_Refactor the solution of fizzbuzz into a (far) more modular version_

### Instructions

* This exercise might look intimidating at first, but the functions are split such that each of them does a single task. Try to take time to understand the flow of logic we've mapped out for you.

As we move through the following challenge please remember to do the following: 

1) Break Down the problem into implementable pseudocode.

- Define the input
- Define the flow of your script/method/Code
- Define the outputs
    

2) Translate that pseudocode into code.

- The pseudocode should help guide you as you code out your project

3) Once functioning refactor

- Does your code repeat itself?
- How can you DRY it up?
- Do your naming conventions adhere to the JS style guide?
- Once refactored does your code still function?


Reminder: FizzBuzz is an exercise in which you are given a list of ordered, consecutive numbers. The goal is to return `fizz` for every multiple of 3 and buzz for every multiple of 5. Naturally, you'll return fizzbuzz for numbers that can be divided by both 3 and 5. All other numbers are returned as themselves.

You will find a series of empty functions also to have code inserted into them.
