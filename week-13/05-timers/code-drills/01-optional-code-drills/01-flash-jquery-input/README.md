# JQuery

## Practice with forms

### Instructions

_In this activity, we're going to be creating a simple website that allows the user to input their information and updates the webpage with the information they just entered when they submit their form. No code is provided for you, but if you get stuck, there's pseudocode available for you in the hint folder_

* There should be five fields for the user:
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Occupation
    * City
    * State

* Once the user clicks the submit button, update the DOM with their information. Group the first name and last name together in a line, and group the city and state together in a line:

    > `First Name` `Last Name`

    > `Occupation`

    > `City`, `State`
