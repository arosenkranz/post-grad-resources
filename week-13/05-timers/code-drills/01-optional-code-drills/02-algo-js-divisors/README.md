## Divisors within an array

### Instructions

_In this activity, we're going to be iterating through an array to check if any number within that array is evenly divisible by another number in the array._

* For example:
    * [3, 25, 6, 19] should return true because 6 is evenly divisible by 3
    * [17, 12, 39, 9, 48] should return true because 48 is evenly divisible by 12
    * [65, 9, 17, 21] should return false because none of the numbers are evenly divisible
