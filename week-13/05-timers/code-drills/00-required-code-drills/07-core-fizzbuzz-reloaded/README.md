## Wibble Wobble

_In this exercise, we're going to iterate through an array of strings. If the current element has an even number of characters, replace it with the string "Wibble". If the element has an odd number of vowels, replace it with the string "Wobble". If it has both replace it with the string "WibbleWobble"_

### Instructions

* This activity is very similar to FizzBuzz, but because we're working with a different data type, the logic is more challenging.
    * For this exercise, only "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u" are considered vowels

* Only code in the indicated sections within the javascript file. You should not have to change the html or any code outside of yor designated areas.
