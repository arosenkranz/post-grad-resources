# Arrays

Welcome to your first challenge! Your first challenge consists of 2 prompts, an easier and a somewhat harder prompt involving Arrays.

Start with `01-array-rotation` before moving onto `02-array-sequence` 

Both prompts include thorough READMEs that should be examined before any work is done.

## Instructions

* Intially, there should be **no** actual coding. You **must** pseudo code. Talk out the problem. How would you explain your solution or thought proccess to a 5 year old?

* Describe every step as clearly as possible. 

```
	Q: What are you going to do? 
	Q: How are you going to do it? 
	Q: Why are you going to do it? 
	Q: What is the consequence / what is the expense? 
```

* Reach an agreement; only once you are both able to thoroughly communicated your pseudocode, do you begin to code it out.
