# Callbacks

## Review

### Instructions

_We will be reviewing callback functions in this activity. You are given 4 helper functions that take in a number and then call on the callback functions given to it. If it wasn't given a callback function then it will just console log the result of applying its assigned math to the argument._

* Inside `challenge-prompt.js`, there are 3 prompts at the end of the file for you to follow. 

* If you need help with the math needed to arrive at the target number, refer to the hints file.

* You only need a single function call in order to complete each prompt and you won't need to define or use any values that aren't give to you. For example, if you were given the number 8 as the variable `eight`, then you can console log the number 63 by

> square(eight, subtractOne)
