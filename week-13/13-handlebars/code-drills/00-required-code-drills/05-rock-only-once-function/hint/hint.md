* This activity tests your understanding of variables and function names as pointers to the associated value of set of instructions

* When you define a function, you are assigning the set of instructions you want associated with the name of the function. Much like assigning a value to a variable.
    * And you can reassign the value of a function much like you can reassign the value of a variable
    > var a = "Hello";

    > a = ["New", "Value"];

    > var b = function() {console.log("Hello")}

    > a = function() {console.log("world")}

* If you're still stuck, refer to the challenge-hint.js file for pseudo code.
