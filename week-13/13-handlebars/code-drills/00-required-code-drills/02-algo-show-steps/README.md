# Algorithms

## Steps

### Instructions

Given a number, create a staircase... The amount of steps should be that of the given number...

A staircase is a series of console logs. Each step is represented by `#`s.

For each step in the straircase, you must use spaces to take up the rest of the space created by the first step. So if we are given the number eight, the last step (or the first we console log) will have one hash and seven spaces.

### Example

Given the number 4, you should console.log:
"#   "
"##  "  
"### "
"####"

Given the number 8, you should console.log:
"#       "  
"##      "
"###     "
"####    "
"#####   "
"######  "
"####### "
"########"
