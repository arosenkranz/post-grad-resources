## First Three Function

### Instructions

_This activity is going to look similar to the previous activity, but we're going to apply a different set of skills to solve this problem. This solution tests a different set of skills from the previous activity and is something that interviewers often ask for._

* Write a function `firstThree` that console logs "Hello, I have been run X times" where `X` is the number of times it's been run so far including the current invocation and then return `true`. After it has been run 3 times, subsequent invocations of this function will not console log anything and return false.

* In the previous activity, you solved a similar problem by reassigning a pointer. This activity is meant to review closure and immediately invoked functions. Do not reassign the pointer to your function within the function.

* Do not use global variables in this activity
