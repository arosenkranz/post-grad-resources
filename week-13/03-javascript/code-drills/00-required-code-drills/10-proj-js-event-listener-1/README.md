## Event Listeners

_Event listeners are one of our many tools for interacting with the user. In conjunction with getElementById, we can create dynamic pages that respond to user input_

### Instructions

1. Create an html page and link your css file.

2. Create an event listener that console logs whatever key that the user presses

2. Within that event listener, create a confirm dialogue when the user presses the `h` key on their keyboard. Store their response.

3. Within your event listener, create an alert when the user presses the `k` key
    * if the user had answered yes in the previous confirm dialogue, have the the alert say "Hello"
    * if the user had answered no in the previous confirm dialogue, have the alert say "No thanks"
