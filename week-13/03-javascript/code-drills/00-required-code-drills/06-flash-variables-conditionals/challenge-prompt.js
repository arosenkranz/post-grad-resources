// declare a variable named farm



// set that farm variable to be an array with the elements
// Pig, Cow, Chicken, Dog, Horse, Sheep



// write an if statement that creates an alert that says "RWAR!" if the first element of farm is not "godzilla"



// write another if statement that creates an alert "SCREECH!" if the last element of farm is "mothra"



// declare a variable named dog with a value of "Spot"


// declare 3 variables cat, car, city without assigning them values


// assign the string "Farley" to cat


// assign the string "San Francisco" to city


// assign the string "Prius" to car


// using string concatenation, console log out the sentence 
// "See Spot run!" without explicitly using "Spot" inside the string.


// using string concatenation, console log out the sentence 
//"I drive Farley around San Francisco in my Prius" without explicityly 
//using "Farley", "San Francisco", and "Prius"
// Remember to use the variables we just declared!


// declare a variable budget and assign it a value of 5000


// declare a variable rentCost and assign it a value of 1500


// declare a variable utilitiesCost and assign it a value of 150


// declare a variable foodCost and assign it a value of 250


// declare a variable transportationCost and assign it a value of 350


// declare a variable computerCost and assign it a value of 2000


// write an if statement that checks whether the sum of all our costs is within the budget.
// if it is within budget, console log out the total cost, otherwise, create an alert telling
// us the sum of all the costs.



// write an if statement that checks whether the rentCost is larger than 
// the sum of the utilitiesCost, foodCost, and transportationCost
// and if computerCost is greater than the sum of rentCost and utilities cost
// if both those statements are true, then create an alert that says "Computer costs are too high!"
// else, create an alert that says "Rent is too high!"
