// More Practice with Variables and Conditionals


// Character One

// make a variable called `characterOneName` and assign it to be a string of "Mr. Farley"


// assign a new value "Ms. Farley" to the variable `characterOneName`


// make a new variable `characterOneAge` and assign it an age of your choice


// reassign the variable `characterOneAge` to be the integer 6


// make a variable called `characterOneSalary` and assign it to be the number 100000.00


// make a variable called `characterOneProfession` and assign it a value of "Web Developer"


// make a variable called `characterOneSpecies` and assign it a value of "cat"


// make a variable called `characterOneLocation` and assign it a value of "San Francisco, CA"


// make a variable called `characterOneRent` and assign it to be the number 2000.00


// make a variable called `characterOneExpenses` and assign it to be the number 1500.00


// make a variable called `characterOneYearlyRent` and assign it to be 12 times `characterOneRent`


// make a variable called `characterOneYearlyExpenses` and assign it to be 12 times `characterOneExpenses`


// make a variable called `characterOneYearlySavings` and assign it to be what remains of character one's salary after removing both the yearly rent and the yearly expenses
// hint: much like in math, you can use parenthesis to define order of operations



// Character Two

// make a variable called `characterOneName` and assign it to be a string of "Mr. Snuggles"


// make a new variable ``characterOneAge`` and assign it to be the number 8


// make a variable called `characterTwoProfession` and assign it a value of "Accountant"


// make a variable called `characterTwoSpecies` and assign it a value of "mouse"


// make a variable called `characterTwoLocation` and assign it a value of "Oakland, CA"


// make a variable called characterTwoRent and assign it to be the number 4000.00


// make a variable called characterTwoSalary and assign it to be the number 90000.00


// make a variable called characterTwoExpenses and assign it to be the number 500.00


// make a variable called `characterTwoYearlyRent` and assign it to be 12 times `characterTwoRent`


// make a variable called `characterTwoYearlyExpenses` and assign it to be 12 times `characterTwoExpenses`


// make a variable called `characterTwoYearlySavings` and assign it to be what remains of character two's salary after removing both the yearly rent and the yearly expenses



// Conditionals

// Create an if statement to check if `characterOneName` is "Mr. Farley"


    // If it does, console log "hello Mr. Farley"

    
// Else, check if `characterOneName` is "Ms.Farley"


    // If it does, console log "hello Ms. Farley"

    
// Else, we know if the code reaches this point that `characterOneName` is neither "Mr. Farley" nor "Ms. Farley"


    // So console.log "Hello stranger"

    


// Create an if statement to check if `characterOneAge` is greather than `characterTwoAge`


    // If it is, console log `characterOneName` prepended to the string " is older"

    
// Else, console log `characterTwoName` prepended to the string " is older"




// Create an if statement to check if `characterOneLocation` is equal to "San Francisco" and if `characterTwoLocation` is equal to "New York"
// hint: You can join two conditionals together using `&&` to signify the `AND` logical operator
//       This means that both conditionals on either side of the `&&` have to be true in order for the two combined to be true


    // If both are true, console log "Cross Country Friends!"

    
// Else, console log "Local Friends!"




// Create an if statement to check if `characterOneYearlySavings` is greater than `characterTwoYearlySavings`


    // If it is, console log `characterOneName` prepended to the string " is a high roller!"

    
// Else, console log `characterTwoName` prepended to the string " is a high roller!"




// Create an if statement to check if `characterOneProfession` is equal to "Web Developer" or if `characterTwoProfession` is equal to "Data Analyst"
// hint: You can join two conditionals together using `||` to signify the `OR` logical operator
//       This means that if at least one conditional on either side of the `||` is true, the combined conditional will also be true


    // If one of them is true, console log "Hey look! One of them is in the tech industry!"

    
// Else, console log "Aww, I wanted to meet someone in tech :("
