// declare a variable named ourArray and assign an empty array to it


// we can `push` values into an array with the push method. Documentation can be found here:
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push

// Let's push the number 1 into ourArray


// push the string "hello" into ourArray


// push the boolean false into ourArray


// push the number 84 into ourArray


// push the string "world" into our Array


// console log ourArray
