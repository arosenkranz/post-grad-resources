* Remember the modulus operator!

* If you're trying to calculate the sum of an array, remember to declare and set the variable you're using to track the sum outside the for loop

* Javascript has a built in method for strings to refer to a character at an index
    * Strings also share methods with arrays in javascript (including bracket notation)

* If you're looking for unique values within an array, you're going to have to either check if that value has been encountered before or if it's already present in the new array of values we're building

* If `testArray[0]` pulls an element out of the array named `testArray` and that element is another array, you can refer to a specific element within that array by adding on another bracket notation `testArray[0][3]`

* When iterating through nested arrays, remember you have to iterate through the outer array and then iterate through each array within that outer array
