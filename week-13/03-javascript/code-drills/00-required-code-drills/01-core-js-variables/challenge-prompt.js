/*
this is a multiline comment
You can comment out many lines at once.
For the most part you will see single line comments
but it is good to see this.
As in single line comments, any code contained within multi-line comments are not run -
meaning that any code commented out is ignored.

//Topic: strings

// Create a variable named `subject` without giving it a value:
// example: var hobby;


// Assign a value of "Programmers" to the variable `subject`
// example: hobby = "problem solving"


// Create a variable `firstName` and assign it a value of an empty string.
// example: var emptyString = "";


// Assign a value of "Ada" to the variable `firstName`


// Create a variable `lastName` and assign it a value of a string "Lovelace".


// Create a variable `fullName` and assign it a value of `firstName` and `lastName` concatenated together with a space between them.


// Create a variable `profession` and assign it a value of a string, "Computer Programmer".


// Create a variable `knownFor` and assign it a value of a string, "first computer programmer".


// Create a variable `firstAlgorithm` and assign it a value of a string, "Analytical Engine".


// Create a variable `cityLocation` and assign it a value of a string, "London";


// Create a variable `countryLocation` and assign it a value of a string, "England";


// Create a variable `nationality` and assign it a value of a string, "British";



//Topic: integers

// Create a variable `birthYear` and assign it a value of the integer, 1815.


// Create a variable `deathYear` and assign it a value of the integer, 1852.


// Create a variable `ageAtPassing` and assign it to be the difference between `deathYear` and `birthYear`.


// Create a variable `yearOfPublish` and assign it a value of the integer, 1842.


// Create a variable `ageAtYearOfPublish` and assign it to be the difference between `yearOfPublish` and `birthYear`.



//Topic: console log

//console log: "First Name: Ada" by concatenating the `firstName` variable to the back of a string of "First Name: "


//console log: "Last Name: Lovelace" by concatenating the `lastName` variable to the back of a string of "Last Name: "


//console log: "Profession: Computer Programmer" by concatenating the `profession` variable to the back of a string of "Profession: "


//console log: "BirthYear: 1815" by concatenating the `birthYear` variable to the back of a string of "BirthYear: "



//Topic: Concat Values

// Create a variable `statementOne` and assign it a value of a string:
// "Programmers: Ada Lovelace is a British Computer Programmer born in 1815."
//
// Use the `subject`, `fullName`, `nationality`, `profession`, and `birthYear` variables instead of hard coding in the full string
// much like you did for the console logs and `fullName`


// Create a variable `statementTwo` and assign it a value of a string:
// "She is commonly referred to as the first computer programmer"
//
// Use the `knownFor` variable instead of hard coding in the full string
// much like you did for the console logs and `fullName`


// Create a variable `statementThree` and assign it a value of a string:
// "In 1842 she published the first Algorithm, the Analytical Engine, at the age of 27."
//
// Use the `yearOfPublish`, `firstAlgorithm`, and `ageAtYearOfPublish` variables instead of hard coding in the full string
// much like you did for the console logs and `fullName`


// Create a variable `statementFour` and assign it a value of a string:
// "She was a British Citizen who lived in London, England until her passing in 1852 at the age of 37.
//
// Use the `nationality`, `cityLocation`, `countryLocation`, and `ageAtPassing` variables instead of hard coding in the full string
// much like you did for the console logs and `fullName`



//Topic: console.log()

//console log statementOne


//console log statementTwo


//console log statementThree


//console log statementFour
