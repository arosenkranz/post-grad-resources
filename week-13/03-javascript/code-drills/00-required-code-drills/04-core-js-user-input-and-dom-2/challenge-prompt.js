// Using the `confirm` method, welcome the user to the Boba Shop and ask them if they would like a boba

    // Prompt the user for what flavor they would like for their drink
    // Store their response into the variable `drinkFlavor`

    
    
    // Write to the DOM a message to the user telling them that their drink will be ready soon.
    // Use string concatenation in order to specify the flavor of their drink

    
// Else, write "Goodbye! Come back soon!" to the DOM
