## Making a Calculator

_We're going to be making a very basic arithmetic calculator that takes in user input and returns the result of the calculation. This is a challenging activity, so remember that there's always the hints folder for you to lean on._

### Instructions

* You'll have to create your own html and js file and link them

* This calculator should only take numbers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, and the `c` key as valid inputs

* Be sure to prevent the user from inputting more than one operator

* When the user presses the `=` key, evaluate the expression that they've entered

* When the user presses the `c` key, clear the expression and what's displayed to the webpage

* It is highly recommended you use functions to section out your logic
