# Javascript

## Switch/Case

### Instructions

In this exercise, you are given a button that renders different text to the page depending on how many times it's been clicked. 

Right now, the text is determined by a large series of else if statements. Your job is to do the same work as those else if statements, but by using a switch/case instead. 

You will also need to include a default case (not included in the current version). The default case should render "Farley has nothing left to say" in the same place the rest of the text is rendered.

Have a look at the way it works now, and then scroll to the bottom of challenge-prompt.html to write your own code. The first case is already given to you.

You may need to look up switch cases if you are having some trouble. Try to google something like `switch case js` (js for javascript).
