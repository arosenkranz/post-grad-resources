## Water Jars

### Instructions

_This is a word problem, so there will be no coding. Just write your answer in a `challenge-prompt.md` file._

* You have three jars:
    1. An 8 cup capacity jar full of water
    2. An empty 5 cup capacity jar
    3. An empty 3 cup capacity jar

* You can only pour water from one jar into another until the jar you're pouring water into is full or the jar your pouring from is empty

* You cannot pour the water from jars anywhere except into another jar

* By only pouring water back and forth between the three jars, end up with exactly 4 cups of water in either the 8-cup jar or the 5-cup jar.

* Write every pour you have to do inside the `challenge-prompt.md` file
