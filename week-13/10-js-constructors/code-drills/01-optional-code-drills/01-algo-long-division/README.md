## Long Division

### Instructions

_In this activity, we're going to be recreating the divide operator without using multiply, divide, or the modulo operators_

* DO NOT use the multiply, divide, or modulo operators

* The function will take in a `dividend` and a `divisor` and return the quotient if the dividend is divided by the divisor.

* If there is a remainder, console log out the remainder, but the returned quotient should still be an integer.

* Run the `test.js` file in order to see if your solution matches the expected outcomes.
