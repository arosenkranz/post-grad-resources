# Algorithms

## Review pt.4

### Instructions

Open challenge-prompt.js, where you'll find two different exercises. The instructions for each exercise are located within the spaces separated for each exercise.

You will not need to alter the index.html file at all, but can open it in your browser to test your solutions.

These algorithms are a little more challenging than the previous three sets. In these exercises, you will parse through arrays and dynamically create objects.
