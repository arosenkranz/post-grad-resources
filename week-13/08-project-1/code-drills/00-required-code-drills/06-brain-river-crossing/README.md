## Farmer Crossing the River

_Wait... No code???_

Nope, no writing code for this exercise. Algorithms are about more than just writing code to automate tasks. On a deeper level, they're about reallu understanding problems, and breaking them down to their fundamental parts. Thinking about how to solve problems without worrying about syntax is good practice for thinking about algorithms at their conceptual level.

### Instructions

For this exercise you will not create a function. Your job instead is to get a poor farmer and his livestock across a grueling river.

The farmer needs to get a chicken, a fox and a bag of grain across a river. He's in quite the pickle though. The only boat around is a small, rickety thing that can only carry him (the farmer) and one of his cargo at a time. That means whenever the farmer crosses the river, he'll have to leave at least two of his animals/possesions behind.

What's worse, if he leaves the chicken and fox alone together, the fox will eat the chicken. If he leaves the chicken and grain alone, the chicken will eat the grain. 

Using only the farmer's rickety boat and its rules, help him get across the river with all of his companions.

There is no "trick" answer to this problem
