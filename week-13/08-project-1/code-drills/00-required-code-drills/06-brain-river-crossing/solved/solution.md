# He made it!

After a lot of long hours thinking, the farmer finally figured it out.

He went across the river with his chicken first, leaving the fox and the grain behind. 

After leaving his chicken on the other side of the river, he came back for either the fox or the grain (I forget which one, but either would work). 

After taking the fox or grain to the destination side of the river, he takes the chicken back with him, leaving the fox/grain alone at the destination. 

When he makes it back to the first side of the river, he takes the remaining item, dropping the chicken back off to the first side of the river. 

When he crosses back over, the  fox and the grain are now on the destination side, and the chicken is left alone on the starting side. He finally travels alone back to the starting side, where he picks up the chicken and brings it along to join the fox and the grain.

Everyone had safely crossed, and they all lived happily ever after (except the grain, it went bad).
