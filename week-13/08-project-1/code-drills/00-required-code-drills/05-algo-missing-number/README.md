## Missing Number

### Instructions

Open challenge-prompt.js, where you'll find a single exercise. The instructions for the exercise are located within the challenge-prompt.js file.

You will not need to alter the index.html file at all, but can open it in your browser to test your solutions.

In this exercise, you will create a function which can identify the "missing element" in a given array. Given a (almost) sequential (1, 2, 3, 4 etc...), yet unsorted, array, you will need to identify the element which stops the array from being completely sequential.

For example, given `[4,1,3]` our function should return `2`. If we sorted the array it would read `[1,3,4]`. Counting up, from the lowest element (1), we can see that the number `2` is missing.
