### Pseudocoding

Complete the Pseudocode for the following Algorithmic Prompts. 

**No Coding**

Each step of your algorithm you should make the following items clear: 

```
What are you going to do?
How are you going to do it? 
Why are you going to do it?
```

## Prompt #1 `sum`

Create a function `calculateSum` that takes in an array of integers. 

Your function returns the sum of all integers within the input array.

Note: Complete only the Pseudocode

### Example
Test Case 1: [1,2,5]
Expected Output: 8

Test Case 2:[1,2,3,4]
Expected Output: 10

Test Case 3:[100,50,75,80]
Expected Output: 305

## Prompt #2 `mean`

Create a function `mean` that takes in an array of integers as an argument. 

Your function returns the `mean` / `average` for all integers within the input array.

The mean is the average, so sum all numbers and then divide by the total number of integers in the input array.

## Prompt #3 `median`

Create a function `median` that takes in an array of integers as an argument. 

Your function returns the median of your input array.


The median is the middle value, so first you will have to sort the numbers then find the middle value

### Example


Test Case 1: [12,3 ,5];
Expected Output: 5

Test Case 2:[3, 13, 7, 5, 21, 23, 39, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29]
Expected Output: 23

Test Case 3:[3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 40, 56]
Expected Output: 22

Note: In the case where the totale number of datapoints is even then we will take the average of the two middle numbers.

## Prompt #4 `mode`

Create a function `mode` that takes in an array of integers as an argument. 

Your function returns the mode of your input array.


The mode is the number that is repeated more often than any other.
