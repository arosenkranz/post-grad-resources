## General Overview


Welcome! 

This time we will continue to work through the previously introduced steps... 

1. **Clarify** 
2. **Inputs/Outputs** 
3. **Test & Edge Cases** 
4. **Naive Solution**
5. **Reach an agreement**
6. **Code It Out**


....but you will be interviewing each other. 
<hr>

### Phase One (2 hours)

1. The class has been divided into `Group A` & `Group B` each group has been assigned a unique set of questions. 

2. You will be sent a selection of Four (`4`) questions and paired with another student that has received a different set of questions. 

3. You will be paired up (2 students) 

4. Each pair will find a private place to work

5. You will be given 15 minutes to individually review the 4 problems without consulting your partners 

6. You will be given 45 minutes to solve the 4 problems with your partner

7. You will be given 30 minutes to examine  provided solutions and work to understand it in pairs

8. You will then rejoin your group and discuss the problems for the remaining 30 minutes  

### Phase Two (2.5 Hours)

1. You will be paired up (2-3 students) 

2. Each pair will find a private place to work

3. You will then alternate being the interviewee and interviewer with your now mastered questions.

Dedicate roughly 15 minutes per question

## Your Assignment

#### As an `Interviewee`

Focus on maintaining:

* Clarity in your mental modeling of your approach
* Openness to feedback, hints, and suggestions
* Playfulness with the puzzle presented
* Engagement with your interviewer


<hr>

#### As an `Interviewer`

Your duty is to: 

1. Study your question well
2. Attempt to answer it without examining the solution
3. Spend time with your group to resolve any unanswered questions, new approaches, etc.
4. Act as an the interviewer to the interviewee, provide suggestions, hints; Etc.
6. Reach an agreement; only once your interviewee has thoroughly communicated their pseudocode, do you invite them to code it out. 

`Note`: 
Hold your interviewee to a high standard

*Did they follow the pattern*:

```
	Q: What are you going to do? 
	Q: How are you going to do it? 
	Q: Why are you going to do it? 

```

### Communication Steps as an `Interviewee`


1. **Clarify** 

> Start by repeating the problem back to the interviewer and ask any clarifying questions and test assumptions about the problem. Request a sample input and expected output if one is not given. 

<hr>  

2. **Inputs/Outputs** 

> Talk through the following: Given a set of inputs what are expected outputs for the problem? 

<hr>  

3. **Test & Edge Cases** 

> Inquire about any edge cases. 

Example: 

* Single character / Empty string
* Empty array
* Negative Numbers

>Write down at least one original concrete test case - you will be using this test case to walk your interviewer through your Pseudocode. 

<hr>  

4. **Naive Solution**

>Start with pseudo/coding the most obvious/naive solution, and let interviewer know this is where you are starting. Remember to talk through your process out loud, and if you get stuck prompt your interviewer for feedback or hints.

For each step of your algorithm you should make the following items clear: 

1. What are you going to do?
2. How are you going to do it? 
3. Why are you going to do it? 


<hr>  

5. **Reach an agreement**

> Only once you and your interviewer are both clear on what your intentions are, communicated with Pseudocode, do you begin to code. 

<hr>  

6. **Code It Out** 

> You will be coding it out on a whiteboard. No autocompletes, no syntax highlighting. Be sure to pay attention to the details and to utilizing proper style guides and conventions. 

While this is considered a `coding interview` this last section, the coding section, is actually the least important. While you should be mindful of syntax and naming convention the interviewer is primarily interested in your technical knowledge, ability to model problems in your head, and the clear communication of said model. 

Your Goal at the coding stage: 

a. Follow the Pseudocode.
b. Be mindful of syntax and naming convention.
c. Focus on clarity and communication (proper / indicative variable and function names).
