## Zipping Arrays

### Instructions

_Given two arrays of numbers, add the elements at the corresponding indices to each other. If an element in one array does not have a corresponding element in the other, add the unmatched element to the output without any modifications._

For example

```javascript
zipArr([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6])
// should return
[6, 8, 3, 4]
```
