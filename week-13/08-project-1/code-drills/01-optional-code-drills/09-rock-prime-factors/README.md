## Prime Factors

### Instructions

_In this activity, we're going to be writing a function that takes in a number and returns an array of all the factors of that number that are also prime numbers. The array should be sorted in ascending order and should not contain any repeated numbers._

For example

```javascript
primeFactors(33)
// should return
[3, 11]
```

and

```javascript
primeFactors(16)
// should return
[2]
```

* Hint: Use helper functions to seperate out the areas of concern for your function and handle any repeated checks you have to do.
