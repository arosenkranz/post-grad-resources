## Repeated Words

### Instructions

_Given an array of strings, return a new array that contains one copy each of all the strings that were repeated in the argument. The returned array should also be in alphabetical order._

For example

```javascript
findRepeats(["Hello", "Yes", "Boat", "Hello", "Kitchen", "Sofa", "Sofa", "Hello", "Boat"])
// should return
["Boat", "Hello", "Sofa"]
```

* If a word is encountered more than twice, it should still only show up once in the returned array
