### Instructions

_We will be getting a bit of practice with loops and automation of repetitive tasks in this activity. We're going to be making our webpage output the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall." If you prefer, you can replace beer with your favorite beverage instead._

```
99 bottles of beer on the wall. 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall!

98 bottles of beer on the wall. 98 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall!
```

Many hours later....

```
2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall!

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall!
```
