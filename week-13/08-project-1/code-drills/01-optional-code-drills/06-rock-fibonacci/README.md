## Fibonacci Sequence

### Instructions

_In this activity, we're going to be writing a function to generate the fibonacci sequence. The function should take in a number (`num`) and return an array containing the first `num` elements of the fibonacci sequence._


* The fibonacci sequence is a sequence where:
    * The first element is 0
    * The second element is 1
    * Every element afterwards is generated by adding together the previous two elements in the sequence

> fibonacci(8)

should return

> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

* You will not have to change anything outside of the coding area provided to you inside the Javascript file.

* The webpage will call the fibonacci function upon submit with the input given and display the return to the webpage
