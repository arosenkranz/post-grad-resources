## Find the combos

### Instructions
Given an array of numbers and a single number, each as a separate argument, create a function which returns two indices within the array that point to values whose sum equals the second argument, or the target number.

If there are multiple values whose sum equals the target, that is ok. We only need to return two of the values.

### Example
Given the following two variables:
var array = [3,5,12,4,19,1,18];
var target = 22;

Our function should return any of the four following values: [0,4], [4,0], [3,6], or [6,3]

Remeber, we are returning the INDICES of the values, not the values themselves
