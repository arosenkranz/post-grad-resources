## Reversing a Sentence

### Instructions

_In this activity, we're going to be writing a function that takes in a string of words seperated by spaces and reverses the order in which the words appear. These `sentence` strings should not contain any punctuation or any spaces adjacent to another space. The return value of the function should be a new string with the order of the words within the `sentence` reversed._

For example, 

```javascript
reverse("hello world goodbye ignorance")
// should return
"ignorance goodbye world hello"
```

* Remember to watch out for extraneous spaces!
