### Instructions

Your success with your very first customer set the tone for the first few months of your business and now word of your currency authentication prowess has spread. You've earned enough to buy a new scale and it's arrived just in time for your appointment with the mayor of the city today.

Your new analytical scale can handle up to ten kilograms of material and can tell you the precise weight of its contents down to the milligram. After you've studied the manual to ensure you know how to access its functions, you settle down to review the advances in both counterfeiting and authentication technology over the past months.

The local authorities had cracked down on the previous generation of counterfeit coins and the lighter version is no longer in circulation. However, the thriving underground counterfeiting cartel recently released a new version of their counterfeit coins. They seemed to have overcompensated for the previous weight deficiency in their coins because the new counterfeits weigh 11 grams compared to the 10 grams of an authentic coin. Other than the weight, they once again created a counterfeit that is identical to the original.

After you finish studying, there was't much to do other than help the customers that show up and wait for the mayor.

The mayor arrived at your stall shortly after your lunch break. She gives your stall an appraising look before motioning towards her assistant. The assistant bustles forward and places a tray with 10 stacks of coins on the table of your stall. A quick examination reveals each stack to contain 10 visually identical coins.

"One of these stacks is counterfeit. Tell me which one and we'll discuss further opportunities for you."

You take a deep breath and think about how to proceed. You'll have to suitably impress the mayor. What is the minimum number of times you need to use the scale in order to find which stack of coins is counterfeit and what are the steps in order to do so.
