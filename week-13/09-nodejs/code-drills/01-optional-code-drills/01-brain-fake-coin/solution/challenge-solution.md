1. Weigh 3 coins against another 3 coins
    * If the 2 piles are the same weight, then one of the 2 remaining coins is the counterfeit, and we can figure out which of them is counterfeit by weighing those 2 coins against each other

2. Take the lighter pile of 3 coins and weight 2 of those coins against each other
    * If the 2 coins are the same weight, then the third coin is the counterfeit
    * If the 2 coins are not the same weight, then the lighter coin is the counterfeit
