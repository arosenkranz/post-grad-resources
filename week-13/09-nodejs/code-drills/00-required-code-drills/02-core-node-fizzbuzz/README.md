## Fizzbuzz

### Instructions

Given a `number` (not an array of numbers), create a function that console.logs every number up until that number. If a number is a multiple of three, console.log("fizz"). If it is a multiple of five, console.log("buzz"). If it is a number of both, console.log("fizzbuzz").

Run your script through the command line using process.argv to pass whatever number you choose.
