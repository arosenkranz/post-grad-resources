## Floats

> In this activity we are goint to be combining different floats

### Instructions

1. Add classes and ids to the `<div>` elements so they hook up with the styling already present

2. Correct the background colors of each text box to correctly match the text within
  * You should end up with a red box, a yellow box, and 2 blue boxes

3. Add the indicated float direction to each of the CSS selectors
  * [CSS clear property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_clear.asp)

4. Play around a bit with the floats to see how they interact with each other
  * What happens if we don't clear the float for the blue boxes?
  * What happens if we float both the red and yellow box left?
  * What happens if we float both the red and yellow box right and the blue boxes left?
