# Google Fu

Ask any developer or engineer what is their most valued skill and you'd be suprised to learn it is not their programming language of choice. It's Googling. Over 9000% (not a made up number, very accurate) of developers on the job admit that a majority of their workflow is time spent googling topics and searching through stack overflow questions. No one knows everything! And you're not going to know or remember everything. Be it an intricate bug or error, to something extremely simple, your success in this industry depends on not only your ability to code, but your ability to _google_

In this activity we will hone the powers of your google fu and become a search engine wizard. Leave no link unclicked and no forum unread, we're going on a google adventure. You will be given various prompts that tasks you with searching for the appropriate topics using proper terms and search operators.

## Tips & Tricks

* In programming, the tried and true method of finding exactly what you want, is to search the _topic_ followed by the name of the language.
    * Example - I don't quite remember how to do a for loop in javascript. Let's google: `for loops javascript`
* Error messages are your friend. If you are unable to debug an error message, google the entire thing!
* Ask google, like you'd ask a real person! Google's search algorithms have advanced quite a bit and can recongize speech patterns.
    * Example - I want to change the text of an HTML element. Let's google: `how to change text of html in javascript`
* There are many search operators that most developers don't know about that can help limit or expand the scope of your search. A complete list of operators and methods can be found [here](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) or... you can google them!

### Instructions

* Create a new markdown files to keep track of what you search
* Each prompt will give you a situation that needs to be addressed or fixed. What would you search to remedy these prompts?
* Write down your search queries for each prompt and pick a few of the returned search results after scanning them

### What would you Google if...

1. You've recently updated your Macbook to the latest release of macOS and suddenly can no longer push or pull to your github repositories. 

2. You've suddenly forgetten the syntax for using switch cases

3. You're feeling a bit creative and want to give your navigation some cool hover effects

4. You've been working with APIs but got this error code when trying to make an AJAX call
    ```
    XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://myApiUrl.io/apiKey=Ajd234mifs04?query=cats No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
    ```
5. You've been using jQuery to create on click listener for some buttons `$('.btn').on('click', function(){//does something})`, however another function is creating new buttons and your on.click listener is not working on the newer buttons

6. You've made an AJAX call to an API endpoint that is supposed to return data that you can append to your HTML, but for some reason no data is being appended.

7. You want to double check the sytax for the `.forEach` method, but don't trust W3Schools and only want results for Mozilla

8. You used the `.sort` method on an array of numbers `[1, 6, 5, 11, 34, 2]`, but for some reason it's sorting it incorrectly and gives you `[1, 11, 2, 34, 5, 6]` instead

9. You made some sick animations using CSS and they look great on Chrome, but you viewed them on a friend's computer who uses Firefox and they're not working

10. You have an array of names `[Sasha, Jimmy, Amber, Robert]` and have created a function that uses a for loop to console log each name in the array after a set amount of time using `setTimeout`, but for some reason it is console logging undefined.

### Remember!

* There are no right or wrong answers, the point of this activity is to get you to actively google and actually read through the search results. The first result may not always provide the best answer, sometimes you have to dig a little to find the gold :)
