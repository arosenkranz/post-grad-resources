## Relative File Paths

> Relative File Paths refer to the location of a file relative to the file that is referencing it

### Instructions

1. Start by creating `<img>` tags with both a `src` and an `alt` attribute
  * Each image we are trying to access is nested inside the `images` folder
  * Remember to use relative file paths for `src`
  * The alt tags should be a description of the image

2. Create a CSS selector so you can modify all the `<img>` tags
  * Add a width so the image doesn't take up the whole page
  * The image will resize to maintain aspect ratio unless you also explicitly define the height
  * Add some padding to each image to separate them from each other

3. BONUS: Add more styling to the images such as a border
