# HTML

## Images and Links

> We'll be going over adding images and links to the webpage you made in the previous activity. If you got stuck in the previous activity, you can work off the html file in the hint folder.

### Instructions

1. Add an image to your page that you like. It could be a picture of you stored online or an image that resonates with you somehow.
    * Remember to add an alt tag to the image!

2. Create an unordered list.

3. Add a link to your Github account as the first element of that list.

4. If you have a LinkedIn page, add a link to that as the second element of the list. If you don't just make the link point to LinkedIn's homepage.

5. Create a placeholder link to your portfolio page as the third element of the list.

6. Add a link to your favorite website as the fourth element of the list.

#### Bonus

* Make your image a link to google.com.
* Make your links open in a seperate tab.
* Embed a youtube video after your links.
