# HTML Practice

## The Basics

>Let's get some more practice making a very basic webpage!

### Instructions

1. Create a new HTML document named `index.html`.

2. Within the file you just created, remember to:
    * Declare the DOCTYPE
    * Create a head tag to put your meta information and page title
    * Indicate the charset as "utf-8" within that head tag

3. Set the title of this webpage to be your name.

4. Add a body tag for the main content of your webpage.

5. Create a heading that's just your name.

6. Create a slightly smaller heading that reads `Master Coder in Training`.

7. Go back and bold the main header you made.
