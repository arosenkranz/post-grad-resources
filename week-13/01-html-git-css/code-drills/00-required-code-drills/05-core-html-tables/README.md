# HTML

## Tables

> We'll be adding multiple tables to our page in this activity. Tables are a good way to organize information for the user. If you got stuck in the previous activity, you can work off the html file in the hint folder.

### Instructions

1. Use the <hr> tag to seperate the tables we're about to make from the rest of the page

2. Create a new table and add a heading for the table we're about to create. Label it as our `Work Experience`.

3. Create labels by making headers for the columns: `Company`, `Position`, and `Dates Employed`

4. Fill in the table with at least 3 jobs you've held. If you haven't worked for three different companies, fill in the table with your dream companies to work for.

5. Use a `<br>` tag to create a space between our two tables.

6. Create a new heading for another table we're making. Label it as your `My Favorite Restaurants`.

7. Make headers for the table columns: `Name`, `Type`

8. Fill in the table with at least 5 of your favorite restaurants and what type of foods they serve.

#### Bonus
* Use the `<span>` tag to add images of the companies' logos to the table. How does wrapping the `<img>` tag in the `<span>` affect its behavior?

* Make the names of the companies and restaurants into links to their official pages.

* Use the `<em>` tag to add emphasis to those names.
