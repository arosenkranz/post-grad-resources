## Relative File Paths pt.2

> We're going to be reviewing relative file pathing along with playing around a bit with floating elements

### Instructions

1. Add in the relative file paths for all 7 images
  * Edit the `src` attribute for each `<img>` tag so they display the correct image
  * The `alt` attribute indicates the file name you are looking for
    * Remember to include the file extension in your path
  * Once you've linked the images, there will be 7 unique images displayed

2. Add a border to the images

3. Some elements come with built in styling!
  * Remove the margin that comes built into `<p>` tags by explicitly defining a new margin for them

4. These images would probably look better side by side
  * Select the `<div>` element and float all of them to left
  * When you float a wrapper element, everything it contains comes along for the ride!

5. Add a margin to every `<div>` element so they aren't all squished together
