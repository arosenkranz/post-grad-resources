* You can select every \<div> element for styling by using:
```css
div {
  property: value;
}
```

* The CSS file is read from top to bottom, so if you define a property that has been previously modified, the code on the bottom of the file will overwrite earlier code 

* Remember to double check your property names!
  * capitalization and punctuation are very important
