# Javascript

## Key Press Listeners

_Create an application that tracks the user's input and records it to the DOM_

### Instructions

Lets have a look back at vanilla javascript and compare it to the other activties that we worked on 
"keep in mine the different syntax" 

Create an application that listens for keys the user presses. The user will be able to see all the keys they've pressed as well as a section showing only the last key they've pressed. 

Have a glance at index.html, then move on to challenge-prompt.js for more instructions.

Good luck!
