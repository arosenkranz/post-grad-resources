## Scope

_We're going to be doing more review of scoping. Scoping is a very important concept to familiarize yourself with because doing so will help immensely with future projects when you have a lot of functions and variables. Open up the `challenge-prompt.js` and answer the questions asked by the comments. Additional instructions are provided at the top of the `challenge-prompt.js` file._

### Instructions
