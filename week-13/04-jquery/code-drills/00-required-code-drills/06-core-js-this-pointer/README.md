### Instructions

We're going to be reviewing the `this` pointer. The behavior of `this` may seem odd and a little overwhelming at first, but hopefully, you'll form a better relationship with it over time. `this` points to whatever invoked the current function or the object that contains the code that uses the `this` pointer. Follow the prompts given within the challenge-prompt.js file.
