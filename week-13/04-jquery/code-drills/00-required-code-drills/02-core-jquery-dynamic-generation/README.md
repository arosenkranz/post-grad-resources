## Creating a Letter Generator

### Instructions

In this exercise, we'll be creating a random letter generator. You are given a button to click on and nothing more. Have a look at index.html, then move on to challenge-prompt.js for more instructions.

When you are done, you should be able to click on the question mark button and generate a new random letter each time.
