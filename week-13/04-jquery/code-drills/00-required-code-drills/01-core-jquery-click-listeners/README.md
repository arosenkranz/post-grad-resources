# JQuery

## Click Listeners

### Instructions

In this exercise, you are given all the letters of the alphabet, printed to the screen. Each letter is nested in its own h3 tag, which in turn has a unique class. 

Your job is to create click listeners for each letter. On click, the clicked letter should print itself to another element. Have a look at the structure of index.html, then open up challenge-prompt.js for more instructions. 

Good luck!
