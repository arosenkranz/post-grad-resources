# React

## `News.com` (Pt.2)

In this 5 part exercise, we'll be building a two-page news app!

The major topics covered in this project are react-router and axios. 

In part two, we'll be creating three components.

### Instructions
1. Inside of src in your news.com app, create a folder named `components`.
2. Notice the structure of the folders we created in pages.Â They are named after the component they contain, and they have one .js file, and one .css file. We'll be following that same structure for our components. Create folders and their corresponding files for the following components:
- Input
- Button
- Card
3. We will worry about adding props to these components later. For now, it's ok to make all of them empty divs
4. Inside of Input, insert an input with the props:
  - type (a placeholder for the input type)
  - value (a placeholder for the input value)
  - name (a placeholder for the input name)
  - onChange (a placeholder function)
5. That's all for this exercise. In part three, we'll be puting out Input component to use.
