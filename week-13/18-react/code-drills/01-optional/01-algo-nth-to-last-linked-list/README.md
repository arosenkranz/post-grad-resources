## Linked List - nth to Last node

In this activity we will be writing a method for a linked list that takes in a positive integer `n` and returns the `n`th to last node of that linked list.

### Instructions

* fill in the code for the `nthToLast` method to the `LinkedList` class that takes in an integer and returns the node which is that many before the final node.

* For example, for the linked list `testList` below:

  > [1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4] -> [5] -> [6] -> [7] -> [8] -> [9]

  * If we call on `testList.nthToLast(3)`, it should return the node `[7]` since that is the 3rd from last node in `testList`
