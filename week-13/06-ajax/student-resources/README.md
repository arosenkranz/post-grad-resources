#### APIs

**API - application program interface**

**AJAX**
**ASYNCHRONOUS JavaScript and XML**

> Ajax is a client-side script that communicates to and from a server/database without the need for a postback or a complete page refresh.

> The method of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page – without reloading the entire page.

#### JSON Parsing

[Back to top](#student-resources)

When you receive data back from an API it is usually in the form of a JSON (Javascript Object Notation) which is a fancier way of saying - one really large javascript object.

So what is parsing? Parsing allows us to manipulate and actually use a given API response.

* `JSON.parse()` converts a string into a javascript object
* `JSON.stringify()` converts an object into a string
* [a more in depth look](https://alligator.io/js/json-parse-stringify/)

<hr>

#### Query Params

[Back to top](#student-resources)

Query parameters allows us to search for specific data given an API. For example, the giphy API takes in a `search` parameter that allows us to find whatever gifs our hearts desires.

Think of it like lego blocks but for an API url. You are building a url and taking the bits and pieces you want in order to get back desired data.

_Most_ APIs will have good documentation that outlines what their parameters are and how to use them. Keep in mind not all documentation is written equally so some might take a little more work understanding.

##### FOCUSED MODE
is just what is sounds like, a concentrated, focused form of thinking

##### DIFFUSED MODE
is a more relaxed thinking state, one the the brain settles into at resting.


> 1. First, we use the focused mode of thinking to understand the basics of a topic without any distractions.

> 2. Then we use the diffuse mode to passively internalize what we have learned and make connections to other things we already knew.

> 3. Afterwards, we go back into focused mode and pare down the connections that we made to the best, most helpful ones.

<hr>

##### Time-boxing

> A timebox is a previously agreed period of time during which a person or a team works steadily towards completion of some goal. Rather than allow work to continue until the goal is reached, and evaluating the time taken, the timebox approach consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished.

<hr>

##### Working Agreements

>Working agreements, also known as team norms, are guidelines developed by the teams as to how they must work together to create a positive, productive process. Working agreements describe positive behaviors that, although basic, often are not automatically demonstrated in team processes.

<hr>

##### Agile Philosophy

>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

>Working software over comprehensive documentation

>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

>PhilosophyResponding to change over following a plan

>That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

<hr>

##### Twelve Principles of Agile Software

>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

>Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

>Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

>Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

>Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

>The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

>Working software is the primary measure of progress.

>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

>Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

>The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.


<hr>

### Empathy

>The ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

**VS.**

>an attitude of superiority manifested in an overbearing manner claims or assumptions
