## Find The Longest Substring With No Repeats

### Instructions

_Write a function `longestSubstring` that takes a string as an argument and returns the longest substring that doesn't contain more than one of each character_

* A substring is a smaller section of a string that maintains the order of the characters within that string without skipping any characters
    * For example, "bghfds" is a substring of "abbgfhdss", but "abgfhds" is not.
