## Merging Sorted Array

### Instructions

_In this activity, we're going to be writing a function that takes in two sorted arrays as arguments and returns a new sorted array that contains all the elements from both arrays_

* Do not concatenate the two arrays together and sort the combined array afterwards

* Iterate through the two arrays concurrently and construct your output array during that iteration. This way, you're not iterating through the same data multiple times.
