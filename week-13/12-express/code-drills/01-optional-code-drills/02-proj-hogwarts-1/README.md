### Overview

In this four part exercise, we'll be creating a Hogwarts app. You will be sending new students to Hogwarts and help them pass their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels).

On one page, a user can add a new student and place them in a house.

On the main page, the user can click on one student at a time and then click on a class.Â Once the student has gotten all the classes, they have passed their owls, and will no longer appear on the page.

Here is a demo: https://hogwarts-415.herokuapp.com/ 

Each exercise in this set builds on the previous. In each exercise, you will be given the solution to the previous ones. If you were unable to fully complete a given exercise, feel free to use the given code in the next exercise. Otherwise, please copy/paste your own work over the code given to you.
