## Now Hiring: Servers Pt.1

### Instructions

_Today's code drills will build towards a full stack app. The first step is going to be setting up our server._

* Follow the instructions in the `server.js` file to set up the routes in order to serve up the HTML. 
    * Our front end guy is working feverishly on the web page, so we only have a very basic page for now.
    * The HTML pages are in the public folder, so pay attention to the path you need to get there when serving them up!

* Let's get our server setup and serve up the placeholder pages! You should only need to modify the `server.js` file.
