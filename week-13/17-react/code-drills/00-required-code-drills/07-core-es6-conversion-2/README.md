# ES5 to ES6 Conversion

### Instructions

 In this function you will be converting the functions inside `old.js` to ES6 format. The function takes in an array of integers and returns a new array with all the even numbers at the front of the array sorted in ascending order and all the odd numbers at the back of the array sorted in descending order.

* Use only arrow notation `() => {}` to declare functions
* Use only `let` and `const` to declare variables
* Use only the built in methods to iterate through arrays. Do not use for loops.
    * Do not use the `sort` method.
    * Follow the code and implement bubble sort using nested `forEach` methods.
* Do not use the `push` or `concat` methods for arrays. Use array destructuring to add the elements together.
