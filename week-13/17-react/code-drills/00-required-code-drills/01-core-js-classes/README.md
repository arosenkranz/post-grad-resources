# ES6

## Constructors => Classes

### Instructions

In this exercise, you are given a series of pre-built constructors. Your job is simply to convert them into ES6 classes.

This means that all the code should function exactly the same, it'll just be presented in a different syntax.

Here is example syntax for a class a a reminder:

```javascript

class Thing {
  constructor(name, id, age) {
    this.name = name
    this.id = id
    this.age = age
  }

  helperFunction(argument) {
    argument = 3
  }


  importantWork() {
    console.log("classes are good alternatives to constructors")
  }

}

```
