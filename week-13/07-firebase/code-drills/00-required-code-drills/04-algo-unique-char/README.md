## Unique characters

### Instructions

For this algorithm, you will create a function that takes one string as an argument.

If the given string contains the same character more than once, return false (it is not a string with all unique characters).

If the given string never has more than once instance of the same character, return true (it is a string with all unique characters).

### Example
- "chicken" will return false because there is more than one instance of the letter "c".

- "robert" will return false because there is more than one instance of the letter "r".

- "ricky" will return true because there is no letter in that word that is repeated.
