# Algorithms

## Odd ones out

### Instructions

_In this activity we're going to be writing a function that will sort an array of integers. The evens numbers will appear first in the sorted array in ascending order and the odd numbers will come after all the even numbes in descending order._ 

For example:

> [5, 32, 9, 47, 22, 6, 33, 17, 20, 73]

Should return:

> [6, 20, 22, 32, 73, 47, 33, 17, 9, 5]

* The skeleton of your function has been provided for you in the `challenge-prompts.js` file.
    * You should not have to change anything outside of the two areas given to you for your code.

* Helper functions seperate out small chunks of functionality in order to improve the ease of understanding and writing your logic
    * Space has been provided for you above the main sort function for helper functions
    * While helper functions are not required, they are strongly recommended

* If you choose to use Javascript's built in `sort` method for arrays, you may only invoke it once and you are not allowed to iterate through the sorted array afterwards.
