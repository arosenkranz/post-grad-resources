## Reversed Primes

### Instructions

_In this activity, we're going to be writing a sorting function that takes in an array of integers and returns a new array that contains only the prime numbers from that argument array sorted in descending order. Prime numbers are numbers that are only evenly divisibly by one and itself._

For example:

> [5, 32, 9, 47, 22, 6, 33, 17, 20, 73]

Should return:

> [73, 47, 17, 5]

* The skeleton of your function has been provided for you in the `challenge-prompts.js` file.
    * You should not have to change anything outside of the two areas given to you for your code.

* You MUST use the built in `sort` method to sort your array of prime numbers. Do not build your own sort method

* DO NOT use the built in `filter` methods

* Helper functions seperate out small chunks of functionality in order to improve the ease of understanding and writing your logic
    * Space has been provided for you above the main sort function for helper functions
    * While helper functions are not required, they are strongly recommended
