* You will probably have to seperate out all the prime numbers from the argument first

* Prime numbers are only divisibly by 1 and itself, so you will have to iterate through the numbers between 2 and itself to check for divisors
    * If you want to challenge yourself, you do not have to iterate all the way up to the number. For example, if a number isn't divisible by two, then what is largest possible divisor it could have?
